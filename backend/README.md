# IDHub Backend

This folder contains a simple demo backend for the **IDHub** project.  
It provides an HTTP endpoint for generating *Decentralized Identifiers* (DIDs).

## What is a DID?

A **DID (Decentralized Identifier)** is a cryptographically verifiable, decentralized identity.  
Unlike traditional identifiers (e.g., email addresses or usernames), a DID is not issued by a central authority but generated by its owner.  
Authenticity is ensured through public/private key pairs.  
This demo creates temporary in-memory DIDs without storing real keys.

## Endpoint

The server implements a single endpoint:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/create-did` | Generates a fresh public/private key pair, derives a demo DID, and returns both as JSON. The private key is not stored or returned. |

## Run locally

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
npm start
The server runs on port 3000 by default.
You can set another port with the environment variable PORT.

Testing the endpoint

You can test the POST /create-did endpoint with curl or Postman.

Using curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/create-did
The response will contain a JSON object with the DID and public key.

Using Postman:
Create a new POST request to http://localhost:3000/create-did
(no body required). The response will display the generated DID and public key.

{ "did": "did:idhub:abc123...", "publicKey": "MCowBQY..." }
